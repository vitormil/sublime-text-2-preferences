3. Change the settings!

### Settings overview

The following settings can be adjusted:

```javascript
{
  "indent": 4,        // How many spaces to use for each level of indentation. "t" means use hard tabs.
  "dasherize": false, // Convert underscores to dashes
  "old": false,       // Output the old-style ":prop val" property syntax. Only meaningful when generating Sass.
  "path": false       // Custom path to your sass bin folder (eg: "/home/richard/.rvm/.../gems/sass-3.2.9/bin")
}
```
